	As a curious and forward-thinking individual I have been within reach of technology for a significant portion of my life -- tinkering on home routers, personal audio equipment and gaming consoles at a young age making familiar use of tech. During my 10 years in customer service, the technology around me made itself more evident. I gained skills worthy of the Information Technology space; landing a role that combined expert interpersonal experience and the vibrant tech focused passion I held. Leading to my current software engineering activity and fervent drive to amplify that position. I am a Full Stack engineer with an astute and passionate record of providing impactful solutions in the software I delivered.
